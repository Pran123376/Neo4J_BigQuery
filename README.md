# big-query-processing-neo4j

The project handles the large databases containing fields so that relations can be built 
on them in many to many order. Neo4J Database handles this task as it is effective for 
Graph-based databases. Cypher Queries created via a python script automate the 
process of relationship-building between the fields, and then a front-end based on the 
Flask server shows the output of desired results.
